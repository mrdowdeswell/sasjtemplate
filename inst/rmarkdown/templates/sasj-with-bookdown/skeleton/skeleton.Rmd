# Typesetting and referencing mathematical expressions {#sec:math}

The mass function for a Poisson distributed random variable \(X\) is denoted by \(p(x)\) and is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Poisson1}
	p(x) =
	\begin{cases}
		{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^x}/{x!}		& \text{for } x=0,1,2,\dots \\
		0 															& \text{otherwise}.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Notice how the equation is labelled and referenced. Below we have an example of an equation that does not have an equation number (only add equation numbers for those equations that are referenced in the text):
\[
	f(y) =  
		\begin{cases}
			\frac{1}{y^2}e^y & \mbox{ if } y < 0, \\ 
			\log(y)          & \mbox{ if } y \geq 0, \\ 
			0                & \mbox{ otherwise.}  
		\end{cases}
\]

Here is another maths example:
\begin{align*}
	g(x) &= (2x^2-x^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
	     &= (x^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
	     &= x, \quad \mbox{ if } x > 0.
\end{align*}

If you want to type bold math roman letters and arabic numbers like $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{1}$, or $\mathbf{0}$ then use 
	the command \verb!\mathbf!. However, if you want to type bold math greek letters like $\bm{\beta}$, $\bm{\Delta}$, or $\bm{\tau}$ then
	use the command \verb!\bm!.

Some basic text is outlined in Section \ref{sec:intro}. You may also reference Subsection \ref{subsec:1} and Subsubsection \ref{subsubsec:1}.

# Tables and figures {#sec:tbls}

Table\ \ref{tab:results} shows an example of a table containing simulation results.
Note that \emph{table captions should go above the tables}. In Figure\ \ref{fig:figure-random-numbers} we can see a graph where uniform random numbers are plotted against the sequence 1 to 30. Note that \emph{captions for figures should go below the figures}.
Furthermore, note that a table or figure always appears either at the top or bottom of a page, regardless of where the table is placed in the text. This behaviour is correct.

# Citing references {#sec:citing}

Firstly you need to create a bibliography file (references.bib in this example) containing the details of all works cited in your manuscript. This can be easily done using reference management software such as JabRef (freely available for download from \url{http://www.jabref.org/}).
Once your bibliography file has been prepared and linked (see the necessary \LaTeX\ code near the end of the TeX file), it is easy to cite works in the text. A list of references containing only the works cited in the text will then be generated automatically and printed at the end of the article.
    
There are several citing styles. When a reference does not form part of the main sentence and needs to be referred to in parentheses as \citep{hall1988}, you can use the code \verb!\citep{hall1988}!. Using \verb!\citet{hall1988}! instead, results in \citet{hall1988}, i.e.\ only the author is printed along with the publication year in parentheses. Other commonly-used styles for citing are shown in Table\ \ref{tab:citing}.

\begin{table}
	\centering\footnotesize
	\caption{abc.}\label{tab:citing}
	\begin{tabular}{lll}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Syntax} & \textbf{Code example} & \textbf{Result in text} \\

# Using the `Rmd for SASJ.Rmd` template {#sec:rmarkdowntemplate}

Sections \ref{sec:intro}--\ref{sec:citing} are precisely the sections^[Except for Figure \ref{fig:figure-random-numbers}, which was produced in R. To include a .eps file into a \LaTeX\ document (such as `graphs.eps` as in the SASJ template on the journal's website), you likely need Ghostscript installed, which can't be counted on being the case on all systems. Of course, if you _do have_ Ghostscript (and the `epstopdf` \LaTeX\ library) installed, then using `knitr::include_graphics('graphs.eps')` in an R code chunk will work.] produced by using a \LaTeX\ compiler to compile the SASJ's `example.tex` file [@SASJtextemplate]. This section covers some further details of using the `.Rmd` template to produce a `.tex` file equivalent to `example.tex` (and implicitly an associated `.pdf` file). 

If you have read through the `Rmd for SASJ.Rmd` file, you will have noticed that it contains primarily plain \LaTeX\ in Sections\ \ref{sec:intro}--\ref{sec:citing} (the `.Rmd` format permits this, thanks to Pandoc). Of course, one of the advantages of using R markdown is the ability to intermingle writing with analysis, results, output and graphics---all in a dynamic way. While writing raw \LaTeX\ may occasionally be unavoidable in order to achieve certain aims, much of what is achieved by the raw \LaTeX\ in Sections\ \ref{sec:intro}--\ref{sec:citing} is also achievable via regular (perhaps easier) R markdown syntax. For example, all the section headings are already implemented using R markdown syntax.

We proceed to recast some of the earlier \LaTeX-produced sections using R markdown syntax. In principle, it is possible to write a complete SASJ-submission-ready document entirely within R markdown (using this template) without ever touching a \LaTeX\ compiler directly^[Of course, behind the `rmarkdown` and `knitr` scenes, Pandoc is calling a \LaTeX\ compiler on your behalf. To this end, it is recommended that you install the [`tinytex` R package](https://yihui.org/tinytex/), a lightweight \LaTeX\ distribution.]. 

## Template installation {#subsec:templateinstallation}

The templates for creating a SASJ `.Rmd` file are exposed by installing the `sasjtemplate` package^[See https://github.com/mrdowdeswell/sasjtemplate and the instructions there.]. After installation, these templates appear in the "New R Markdown" dialog box, which may be accessed in RStudio through _File_ > _New File_ > _R Markdown..._, and then selecting "From Template" in the left pane. After providing a name^[This will be both the name of a directory/folder that will be created in a location to be specified, as well as the name of your new `.Rmd` file.], and indicating a location^[This is the directory/folder where the new template folder will be created.], RStudio will create a new folder in the specified location that will hold four files: your newly created `.Rmd` file, `SASJ.sty`, `sasj.bst`, and `references.bib`.

## Template file structure {#subsec:filestructure}

In order to compile to `.pdf`, your `.Rmd` file (well, Pandoc, really) will need supporting files used in the creation of the SASJ article: `SASJ.sty`, `sasj.bst`, and `references.bib`. These three files are the original files provided as part of the SASJ TeX template [see, for example, @SASJtextemplate]. Of these, the only one you would need to edit or replace is `references.bib` (with your own references relevant to your article).

For example, if you provided the name "Inference article for SASJ" in the "New R Markdown" dialog box above, RStudio will create a folder called "Inference article for SASJ" that contains `Inference article for SASJ.Rmd`, `SASJ.sty`, `sasj.bst`, and `references.bib`. You should be able to immediately knit this `.Rmd` file!^[This presupposes that your RStudio installation already has knowledge of a \LaTeX installation---[`tinytex` R package](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) is a recommended, lightweight, \LaTeX installation.] 

## YAML frontmatter

The `Rmd for SASJ.Rmd` template file has extensive top-level YAML for providing various SASJ article elements. The YAML frontmatter includes comments (primarily the same comments that appear in the `example.tex` file on the journal's website) to provide guidance on these elements, supplemented with comments from the journal's author guidelines [@SASJauthorguidelines].

Be aware of the initial (two space) indentation of certain elements in the YAML frontmatter (`title`, `running_title`, and `abstract`, in particular). In fact, be aware of spacing and newlines when writing R markdown documents in general. Many markdown typesetting problems are often resolved by judicious use of spacing (either actual spaces, or newlines) in the `.Rmd` source file.

## The top-level `output` format used in the `.Rmd` file

The default `output` format in the YAML frontmatter of the `.Rmd` template is `sasjtemplate::with_bookdown`.

```
output:
  sasjtemplate::with_bookdown:
    keep_tex: true
```

This makes use of the additional citing and referencing functionality in the `bookdown` package^[The `bookdown` package, and its dependencies, are installed when the `sasjtemplate` package is installed.] [@yihui2016]. The `bookdown` package allows some finer control over certain features, as indicated in subsequent sections.

## Typesetting and referencing mathematical expressions {#subsec:mathexpress}

Mathematical expressions may be entered exactly as described in Section \ref{sec:math}. Numbered, labelled equations may be referenced using (`\ref{eqn:Poisson1}`). So, for example: "the probability mass function of a Poisson variable is provided in (\ref{eqn:Poisson1})". Note that the SASJ guidelines indicate that "it is preferable not to use the word 'Equation' with the equation number when referencing" [@SASJauthorguidelines].

Alternatively, you may reference equations (and sections, subsections, tables, figures, etc.)\ using the syntax `\@ref(eqn:Poisson1)` instead of (`\ref{eqn:Poisson1}`), the latter being essentially raw \LaTeX.

Which approach to use is solely a matter of preference and may depend on your background and familiarity with \LaTeX.

## Enumerated and itemised lists

Here is an example of a nested enumerated list in R markdown.

1. Level 1
    (a) Level 2
        i. Level 3
            A.  Level 4 (note that two spaces are required after the . if a capital Roman letter is used)

Here is an example of a nested itemised list in R markdown.

* Level 1
    - Level 2
        + Level 3
            * Level 4

## Theorems, propositions, etc. {#subsec:thmsprops}

### Using the `sasjtemplate::with_bookdown` output format functionality

The `sasjtemplate` exposes functionality provided by the `bookdown` package. It is therefore possible to use the following markdown syntax to provide a theorem (and a label for it, `#thmlabel`, to use for referencing).

    ::: {.theorem #thmlabel}
    The advantage of using this `bookdown` theorem environment syntax is that it may 
    **contain** any _Markdown_ syntax^[Even footnotes!].
    :::

```{r show-theorem-if-bookdown-being-used, results = 'asis', include = FALSE}
if ("sasjtemplate::with_bookdown" == rmarkdown::all_output_formats(knitr::current_input())) {
cat('::: {.theorem #thmlabel}', 'The advantage of using this `bookdown` theorem environment syntax is that it may **contain** any _Markdown_ syntax^[Even footnotes!].', ':::', sep = '\n')
}
```

::: {.theorem #thmlabel}
The advantage of using this `bookdown` theorem environment syntax is that it may **contain** any _Markdown_ syntax^[Even footnotes!].
:::

This generates a theorem environment which may be referenced using `\@ref(thm:thmlabel)`. Similar syntax may be used to create labelled and referenceable proof (`.proof`), proposition (`.proposition`), corollary (`.corollary`), lemma (`.lemma`), definition (`.definition`), and remark (`.remark`) environments. See @yihui2016 (and [markdown extensions by `bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#theorems), in particular) for further details.

### Using vanilla \LaTeX

If you choose, you may still write your theorems, propositions, etc.\ as in Section \ref{sec:thms} (using regular \LaTeX), and use the referencing syntax described in Subsection \ref{subsec:mathexpress}.

## Tables and figures



## Section headings and references {#subsec:secheadrefs}



## Citing references {#subsec:citing}

You still need to create a bibliography file (`references.bib` in this example) containing the details of all works cited in your manuscript. The `SASJ.sty` \LaTeX\ stylesheet uses `natbib` to manage citation references.

Once your bibliography file has been prepared and linked (by providing the name of the `.bib` file in the top-level YAML frontmatter of this `.Rmd` file, e.g.\ `bibliography: references.bib`), it is easy to cite works in the text.

When a reference does not form part of the main sentence and needs to be referred to in parentheses as [@hall1988], you can use `[@hall1988]`. Using `@hall1988` instead, results in @hall1988, i.e.\ only the author is printed along with the publication year in parentheses. For citing references, Table \ref{tab:Rmdciting} provides the equivalent R markdown syntax^[Note that Table \ref{tab:Rmdciting} was produced using an R `data.frame` and a vanilla `knitr::kable()` command (see the `Rmd for SASJ.Rmd` template for the implementation). There are also additional R packages for further manipulation and styling  of publication-quality tables (see, for example, the `kableExtra` package).] of the \LaTeX\ commands in Table \ref{tab:citing}.

The [SASJ guidelines for authors](https://www.journals.ac.za/index.php/sasj/libraryFiles/downloadPublic/135) provide some further examples of references, which have been incorporated into the `references.bib` file for this template. See @abramstegun for a book reference. For articles in journals, see @bck1992 or @gburtrumbo1995. For a proceedings article, see @wolfinger1999, and for a chapter in a book, see @ben1994.

```{r equiv-Rmd-citing}
cite.table <- data.frame(
  syntax = c('\\verb![@...]!', '', '', '', '', '\\verb!@...!', '', ''),
  rmd    = c('\\verb![@fisher1939]!', '\\verb![@fisher1939; @hall1988]!', '\\verb![@hall1988, p.\ 931]!', '\\verb![see, for example, @fisher1939]!', '\\verb![see, @hall1988, p.\ 931]!', '\\verb!@fisher1939!', '\\verb!@fisher1939; @hall1988!', '\\verb!@fisher1939 [p.\ 13]!'),
  result = c('\\citep{fisher1939}', '\\citep{fisher1939,hall1988}', '\\citep[p.~931]{hall1988}', '\\citep[see, for example,][]{fisher1939}', '\\citep[see][p.~931]{hall1988}', '\\citet{fisher1939}', '\\citet{fisher1939,hall1988}', '\\citet[p.~13]{fisher1939}'))
```

```{r Rmdciting}
knitr::kable(cite.table, 
  format     = 'latex', 
  toprule    = '\\toprule',
  midrule    = '\\midrule',
  bottomrule = '\\bottomrule',
  position   = 'tb',
  align      = 'cll',
  col.names  = c('Syntax', 'R markdown example', 'Result in text'),
  caption    = 'Using R markdown for citing references.',
  linesep    = '',
  vline      = '',
  escape     = FALSE
  )
```

## Adding appendices

The SASJ template doesn't include appendices but the SASJ author guidelines [@SASJauthorguidelines] do mention their use. Appendices may be added using:

```
# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-}

# Source code {#app:sourcecode}

# Supplementary graphs {#app:suppgraph}
```

The first line tells `bookdown` that the sections that follow are all to be treated as appendices. The next two lines will create two appendices (one titled "Source code" and the other titled "Supplementary graphs"). These appendices may be labelled and referenced as regular sections are (for example, "see Appendix `\ref{app:sourcecode}` for the source code used, and Appendix `\ref{app:suppgraph}` for supplementary graphs").
